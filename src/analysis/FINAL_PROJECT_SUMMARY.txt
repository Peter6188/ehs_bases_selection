üè•üöë NOVA SCOTIA EHS OPTIMIZATION: FINAL PROJECT SUMMARY
================================================================================
Generated: 2025-07-24 23:00:35

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This capstone project developed and implemented an advanced Emergency Health Services 
(EHS) optimization system for Nova Scotia, integrating hospital performance data with 
population-based analysis to create an intelligent, efficient EMS base placement strategy.

METHODOLOGY EVOLUTION:
==============================

PHASE 1: INITIAL POPULATION-BASED ANALYSIS
‚Ä¢ Started with basic K-means clustering using population data
‚Ä¢ Original approach: 12 EMS bases with limited coverage
‚Ä¢ Challenge: Only 53.3% coverage within 15km threshold

PHASE 2: ENHANCED POPULATION OPTIMIZATION
‚Ä¢ Expanded analysis from k=20 to k=60 to find optimal coverage
‚Ä¢ Enhanced K-means with population weighting
‚Ä¢ Result: 60 EMS bases achieving 94.6% coverage (Method 1)

PHASE 3: HOSPITAL PERFORMANCE INTEGRATION (BREAKTHROUGH)
‚Ä¢ Integrated 48 hospitals with performance metrics
‚Ä¢ Added ED Offload Interval and EHS Response Time data
‚Ä¢ Developed composite weighting: 60% population + 40% coverage gaps
‚Ä¢ Result: 45 EMS bases achieving 96.7% coverage (Method 2)

FINAL RESULTS COMPARISON:
===================================

METHOD 1 (Population-Only):
‚ùå 60 EMS bases required
‚ùå 94.6% coverage
‚ùå No healthcare system integration
‚ùå No strategic prioritization

METHOD 2 (Hospital-Integrated):
‚úÖ 45 EMS bases required (-25% reduction)
‚úÖ 96.7% coverage (+2.1% improvement)
‚úÖ 48 hospitals performance-integrated
‚úÖ Strategic priority-based deployment
