================================================================================

METHOD 1: POPULATION-ONLY K-MEANS CLUSTERING
==================================================
Approach: Traditional population-weighted K-means clustering
Focus: Maximize population coverage without healthcare context
Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Population density as primary weighting factor
‚Ä¢ Geographic distribution optimization
‚Ä¢ Standard distance-based clustering

RESULTS:
‚Ä¢ EMS Bases Required: 60
‚Ä¢ Coverage Achieved: 94.6% (within 15km)
‚Ä¢ Population Served: 969,383
‚Ä¢ Efficiency: 1.58% coverage per base

LIMITATIONS:
‚ùå Ignores existing hospital infrastructure
‚ùå No consideration of healthcare performance
‚ùå Resource inefficient (60 bases required)
‚ùå No priority-based deployment strategy

METHOD 2: HOSPITAL-PERFORMANCE-INTEGRATED K-MEANS
============================================================
Approach: Healthcare-system-aware optimization with performance integration
Focus: Strategic EMS placement considering hospital capacity and performance
Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Hospital performance data integration
‚Ä¢ Coverage gap analysis and weighting
‚Ä¢ Priority-based EMS deployment
‚Ä¢ Healthcare infrastructure awareness

RESULTS:
‚Ä¢ EMS Bases Required: 45
‚Ä¢ Coverage Achieved: 96.7% (within 15km)
‚Ä¢ Population Served: 969,383
‚Ä¢ Efficiency: 2.15% coverage per base

HOSPITAL INTEGRATION METRICS:
‚Ä¢ Hospitals Analyzed: 48
‚Ä¢ Hospitals with Performance Data: 48
‚Ä¢ Average Hospital Performance: 0.655
‚Ä¢ Average Distance to Hospital: 14.1 km

COVERAGE GAP ANALYSIS:
‚Ä¢ Average Coverage Gap Score: 0.434
‚Ä¢ Communities with Poor Coverage: 19
‚Ä¢ High Priority EMS Bases: 2

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
==============================

EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS:
‚Ä¢ Base Reduction: 60 ‚Üí 45 bases (25.0% reduction)
‚Ä¢ Coverage Improvement: 94.6% ‚Üí 96.7%
‚Ä¢ Efficiency Gain: 1.36x better coverage per base

STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES OF METHOD 2:
‚úÖ RESOURCE EFFICIENCY: 25.0% fewer EMS bases required
‚úÖ INTELLIGENT PLACEMENT: Hospital performance data drives optimization
‚úÖ PRIORITY TARGETING: 2 high-priority bases in critical areas
‚úÖ HEALTHCARE AWARENESS: Considers existing infrastructure capacity
‚úÖ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION: Addresses 19 underserved communities

METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS:
‚Ä¢ Composite weighting: 60% population + 40% coverage gap
‚Ä¢ Performance scoring: ED offload + response times + hospital type
‚Ä¢ Distance penalties: Performance degraded by hospital distance
‚Ä¢ Priority classification: High/Medium/Low based on coverage gaps

RECOMMENDATIONS:
====================
üéØ ADOPT METHOD 2 for Nova Scotia EMS optimization because:

1. EFFICIENCY: Achieves better coverage with 25% fewer resources
2. INTELLIGENCE: Integrates real healthcare performance data
3. TARGETING: Prioritizes deployment in areas with poor hospital coverage
4. REALISM: Accounts for existing healthcare system constraints
5. SUSTAINABILITY: More efficient resource allocation for long-term viability

CONCLUSION:
Method 2 (Hospital-Performance-Integrated) represents a significant advancement
in EMS optimization methodology, providing a more realistic, efficient, and
strategically sound approach to emergency medical services deployment.
