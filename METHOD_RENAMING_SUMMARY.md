# EMS Base Optimization Method Renaming Summary

## Previous Naming ❌

- **Method 1**: Population-Only K-means (80 bases, 100% coverage)
- **Method 2**: Hospital-Performance-Integrated (45 bases, 96.7% coverage) 
- **Method 2B**: Emergency Hospital Co-located (76 bases, 100% coverage)

## New Naming ✅

- **Method 1**: Population-Only K-means (80 bases, 100% coverage) - *Unchanged*
- **Method 2**: Emergency Hospital Co-located (76 bases, 100% coverage) - *Former Method 2B*
- **Method 3**: Hospital-Performance-Integrated (45 bases, 96.7% coverage) - *Former Method 2*

## Rationale for Renaming

The renaming reflects a more logical progression from simple to complex methodologies:

1. **Method 1** (Population-Only): Basic demographic approach using only population density
2. **Method 2** (Emergency Hospital Co-located): Builds on existing infrastructure by using hospitals as base locations
3. **Method 3** (Hospital-Performance-Integrated): Most sophisticated approach using hospital performance analytics

## File Updates Made

### Analysis Files
- `method2_emergency_hospital_colocated_analysis.py` - Updated to Method 2
- `method3_hospital_performance_integrated_analysis.py` - Updated to Method 3

### Dashboard Files
- `final_three_method_comparison_dashboard.py` - Updated with new naming
- All charts, labels, and descriptions updated to reflect new method numbers

### Data Files (No changes needed)
- Method 1: `optimal_ems_locations_80bases_complete_coverage.csv`
- Method 2: `corrected_hospital_colocated_ems_locations.csv` 
- Method 3: `hospital_integrated_ems_locations_45bases.csv`

## Summary Comparison

| Method | Approach | Bases | Coverage | Efficiency |
|--------|----------|-------|----------|------------|
| Method 1 | Population-Only K-means | 80 | 100.0% | 1.25% per base |
| Method 2 | Emergency Hospital Co-located | 76 | 100.0% | 1.32% per base |
| Method 3 | Hospital-Performance-Integrated | 45 | 96.7% | 2.15% per base |

## Updated Recommendations

- **For immediate implementation**: Method 2 (leverages existing emergency hospital infrastructure)
- **For optimal efficiency**: Method 3 (highest coverage per base with sophisticated optimization)
- **For maximum coverage guarantee**: Method 1 (traditional population-based approach)
