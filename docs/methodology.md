# Enhanced EHS Base Location Analysis
## Incorporating Real-World Performance Data

Based on the `Emergency_Health_Services_20250719.csv` data you've added, here are the **critical additional considerations** that should be incorporated into the optimal EHS base location strategy:

## üè• **Key Insights from Current EHS Performance Data**

### Data Contains:
- **ED Offload Intervals** by hospital (2021-2023)
- **EHS Response volumes** by zone
- **Performance across 4 zones**: Central, Eastern, Northern, Western
- **Hospital-specific performance metrics**

## üéØ **Additional Considerations for Optimal EHS Base Locations**

### 1. **Hospital Capacity & Offload Performance**
**Current Issue**: ED Offload intervals vary dramatically between hospitals
- **Cobequid Community Health Centre**: ~7,000-9,000 min average offload
- **Dartmouth General Hospital**: ~15,000-20,000 min average offload

**Optimization Impact**:
- EHS bases should be positioned to **avoid high-offload hospitals** when possible
- **Weight hospital efficiency** in base location decisions
- Consider **hospital capacity constraints** as location factors

### 2. **Historical Response Volume Patterns**
**Data Shows**: EHS response volumes by zone and time
- Central zone: ~3,500-5,000 responses/month
- Seasonal variations in demand

**Optimization Impact**:
- **Demand-based weighting**: Use historical response volumes, not just population
- **Seasonal adjustments** for tourist areas (e.g., coastal regions)
- **Time-series analysis** to predict future demand patterns

### 3. **Zone-Based Performance Variations**
**Current Structure**: 4 operational zones (Central, Eastern, Northern, Western)

**Optimization Impact**:
- **Respect zone boundaries** in base placement
- **Zone-specific performance targets** rather than province-wide averages
- **Inter-zone backup coverage** planning

### 4. **Hospital as EHS Base Integration**
**Your Key Point**: "Hospitals can also be seen as EHS bases"

**Enhanced Strategy**:
- **Dual-purpose facilities**: Hospitals that can serve as EHS dispatch points
- **Efficiency weighting**: Prioritize high-performing hospitals as base locations
- **Avoid overloaded facilities**: Don't co-locate bases at hospitals with poor offload times

## üîß **Recommended Enhanced Optimization Model**

### Updated Objective Function:
```
Minimize: 
  Œ± √ó Population_Weighted_Distance + 
  Œ≤ √ó Hospital_Offload_Penalty + 
  Œ≥ √ó Historical_Response_Volume_Distance +
  Œ¥ √ó Zone_Balance_Penalty

Subject to:
  - 100% coverage within 15km
  - At least 1 base per zone
  - Maximum 1 base per high-offload hospital
  - Seasonal demand considerations
```

### Weight Parameters:
- **Œ± = 0.4**: Population-weighted distance (primary)
- **Œ≤ = 0.3**: Hospital performance penalty
- **Œ≥ = 0.2**: Historical demand patterns
- **Œ¥ = 0.1**: Zone balance requirements

## üìä **Specific Recommendations for Your Analysis**

### 1. **Hospital Performance Integration**
```python
# Add hospital efficiency score to location algorithm
hospital_efficiency = 1 / (average_offload_time + 1)
location_score = population_weight √ó distance_penalty √ó hospital_efficiency
```

### 2. **Historical Demand Weighting**
- Use EHS response volumes as additional sample weights
- Weight recent data higher than older data
- Account for seasonal patterns in tourist areas

### 3. **Zone-Constrained Optimization**
- Ensure at least 2-3 bases per zone for redundancy
- Central zone may need more bases due to higher volume
- Eastern/Northern zones may need strategic placement due to geography

### 4. **Hospital Avoidance Strategy**
- **Avoid** placing EHS bases at hospitals with:
  - Offload times > 15,000 minutes
  - Consistently increasing offload trends
  - High seasonal variability

### 5. **Multi-Objective Optimization**
- Primary: 15-minute coverage
- Secondary: Minimize population-weighted response time
- Tertiary: Optimize hospital offload distribution
- Quaternary: Ensure zone-level redundancy

## üéØ **Updated 12-Base Strategy with Performance Data**

### High-Priority Bases (Based on Performance Data):
1. **Halifax Metro** (2 bases) - High volume, split hospital loads
2. **Cobequid area** (1 base) - Good hospital performance 
3. **Truro** (1 base) - Central zone coverage
4. **Sydney** (1 base) - Eastern zone primary
5. **New Glasgow** (1 base) - Northern zone

### Performance-Optimized Bases:
6. **Kentville** (avoid overloading Central hospitals)
7. **Bridgewater** (Western zone coverage)
8. **Yarmouth** (Western zone remote coverage)
9. **Antigonish** (Eastern zone backup)
10. **North Sydney** (backup for Cape Breton)
11. **Glace Bay** (remote Eastern coverage)
12. **Digby** (Western zone coastal)

## üìà **Expected Improvements with Enhanced Model**

### Performance Gains:
- **Reduced average offload times** by avoiding overloaded hospitals
- **Better seasonal response** by incorporating historical patterns
- **Improved zone-level redundancy** 
- **More realistic coverage** based on actual operational constraints

### Validation Metrics:
- Compare against historical response time data
- Validate against actual EHS performance by zone
- Test seasonal demand scenarios
- Assess hospital capacity utilization

---

**Conclusion**: Your addition of real EHS performance data significantly improves the optimization model. The enhanced approach considers not just population and distance, but also operational efficiency, historical demand patterns, and system capacity constraints.

This creates a more **operationally realistic** and **performance-driven** EHS base location strategy! üöÅ
