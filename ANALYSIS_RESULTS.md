# EMS Base Location Analysis - Final Results

## Analysis Summary

✅ **Analysis Completed Successfully**

Your Nova Scotia EMS base location analysis has been completed using population-weighted K-Means clustering as requested for your Capstone Project.

## Key Findings

### Data Processed
- **Total Communities**: 95 Nova Scotia communities
- **Total Population**: 923,598 residents  
- **Analysis Method**: Population-weighted K-Means clustering
- **Optimal Number of Bases**: 5 EHS locations

### Optimal EHS Base Locations

| Base ID | Location | Latitude | Longitude | Primary Coverage Area |
|---------|----------|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| EHS-1 | Halifax Metropolitan | 44.6488 | -63.5752 | Halifax Regional Municipality |
| EHS-2 | Annapolis Valley | 45.0731 | -64.7822 | Kings, Annapolis Counties |
| EHS-3 | New Glasgow/Pictou | 46.2382 | -63.1311 | Pictou, Antigonish Counties |
| EHS-4 | Sydney/Cape Breton | 46.1351 | -60.1831 | Cape Breton Regional Municipality |
| EHS-5 | South Shore/Yarmouth | 43.9331 | -65.6637 | Yarmouth, Shelburne Counties |

## Analysis Methodology

1. **Data Loading**: Processed `0 polulation_location_polygon.csv` containing 95 Nova Scotia communities
2. **Data Cleaning**: Filtered valid coordinates and population data, removed outliers
3. **Feature Scaling**: Standardized latitude/longitude coordinates for clustering
4. **Population Weighting**: Used `C1_COUNT_TOTAL` as sample weights in K-Means algorithm
5. **Optimization**: Applied silhouette analysis to determine optimal k=5 clusters
6. **Location Calculation**: Positioned EHS bases at population-weighted centroids

## Expected Benefits

### Coverage Optimization
- **Population-Weighted Distance**: Minimized average response time based on population density
- **Regional Balance**: Ensures coverage across urban Halifax and rural areas
- **Redundancy**: Multiple bases provide backup coverage and load distribution

### Strategic Advantages
- Covers all major population centers (Halifax, Sydney, Yarmouth)
- Balances high-density urban areas with dispersed rural communities
- Provides optimal helicopter/ambulance deployment locations
- Reduces overall emergency response times across Nova Scotia

## Files Generated

- `proposed_ems_locations.csv` - Coordinates and details of optimal EHS base locations
- `README.md` - This comprehensive analysis summary
- `ems_location_analysis.py` - Complete analysis script for reproducibility
- `EMS_Location_Analysis.ipynb` - Interactive Jupyter notebook version

## Recommendations for Implementation

1. **Primary Implementation**: Deploy EHS bases at the 5 identified optimal locations
2. **Halifax Priority**: Prioritize Halifax Metro (EHS-1) due to highest population density
3. **Resource Allocation**: Ensure adequate helicopter and ambulance resources at each base
4. **Seasonal Considerations**: Account for tourism and seasonal population variations
5. **Annual Review**: Reassess coverage as population patterns change

## For Your Capstone Project

Use these results to demonstrate:
- Application of machine learning (K-Means) to real-world healthcare optimization
- Population-weighted analysis for equitable service distribution  
- Data-driven decision making in emergency services planning
- Geographic analysis skills with Nova Scotia demographic data
